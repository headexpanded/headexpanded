## Hello World

- Back in '98 I bought two Dell 486's from the Salvation Army 2nd-hand shop

- Spent the next *x* hours/days/months installing and configuring Debian on them and getting them to talk to each other.

- Little by little my career moved away from coding and towards management of business platforms: people, processes, P&L, that sort of thing.

## BUT NOW I'M BACK

- I did a 4-month, 525 hour, full-stack web development course!
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, SQL, PHP, APIs, Laravel, Tailwind.
- (still wrangling Linux, too)

## [Random Steely Dan](https://github.com/headexpanded/random_steely_dan)

- a Chrome extension which puts a random Steely Dan lyric notification in your browser once every 8 hours or so
- and then [tweets it](https://twitter.com/randomsteelydan)
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GraphQL

## [Fat Slob Plumbing](https://github.com/headexpanded/fat_slob_plumbing)

- I hope you've got a sense of humour.
- React, TypeScript, CSS, GraphQL

## [Streemer](https://github.com/headexpanded/streemer)

- Pay-as-you-go for your energy: connect your smart-meter, set your payment limit, & streem your energy cash-flows
- Laravel, Inertia/React, TailWind, some custom CSS, MySQL

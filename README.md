## Hello World

Here are three projects I'm working on:

## [Random Steely Dan](https://github.com/headexpanded/random_steely_dan)

- a Chrome extension which puts a random Steely Dan lyric notification in your browser once every 8 hours
- Available now in the [Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/random-steely-dan/ohmpmkjhiadganahhcaakeacniikloni?hl=en-GB)
- TypeScript, HTML, CSS, GraphQL
- Comming soon: [auto-tweet](https://twitter.com/randomsteelydan) each notification

## [Fat Slob Plumbing](https://github.com/headexpanded/fat_slob_plumbing)

- I hope you've got a sense of humour.
- This "business" in northern England provides a unique service.
- React, TypeScript, CSS, GraphQL

## [Streemer](https://github.com/headexpanded/streemer)

- Pay-as-you-go for your energy: connect your smart-meter, set your payment limit, & streem your energy cash-flows
- Laravel, Inertia/React, TailWind, some custom CSS, MySQL
- Probably going to turn it into a To Do app
- Quite pleased with the home page CSS, and the loud colour palette.

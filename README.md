## Hello World

- Hi, I’m Mark.

- Back in '98 I was working in Melbourne for a small company which hired a Python consultancy, "Object Craft".

- Linux was quite new at the time: I asked these guys "what Linux flavour would you install?"

- They replied "Debian".

- I *should* have asked "what Linux flavour would you install *if you were me?*, seeing as how I had zero chops.
- So I bought two Dell 486's from the Salvation Army 2nd-hand shop and spent the next *x* hours/days/months installing and configuring Debian on them and getting them to talk to each other.
- This is back in the days of Woody, dial-up modems, and How-Tos.
- As time went by I got quite handy with Python - *Python 1.5* - then I moved to Luxembourg to build a bespoke quantitative fund analysis tool for a private bank here.
- I wanted to use Python and MySQL, but...private bank, risk-averse IT department, etc etc, so I had to use what was on the desktop: MSAccess and VBA. Got it done though.
- Got through a few more projects: integrating legacy back-office system reporting across business units and so on.
- Little by little my career moved away from coding and towards management of business platforms: people, processes, P&L, that sort of thing.
- I regret not sticking with coding because I really like it.

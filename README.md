- Hi, Iâ€™m Mark. I like reading and writing - good sentences, good stories, and good code. 
- I just finished a 4-month, 525 hour bootcamp, learning fullstack web development.
- I'm interested in back-end and front-end; Laravel, React, and vanilla CSS in particular
-  ðŸ‘€ Also, if you need copy, or some proof-reading, let me know.

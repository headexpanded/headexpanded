## Hello World

- Back in '98 I bought two Dell 486's from the Salvation Army.

- Installed Debian on them over a modem (Woody).

- Started learning Python so I could work with the devs at my fund management job.

- Also HTML, CSS, JS, SQL for same reason.

- Over time my career moved towards management: people, processes, P&L, that sort of thing.

## BUT NOW I'M BACK

- I did a 4-month, 525 hour, full-stack web development course!
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, SQL, PHP, APIs, Laravel, Tailwind.
- (still wrangling Linux, too)
